##### `Entitlements` *{`[]shared.AppEntitlementReference`}*
The list of entitlements that were provisioned. This is leftover from an older design, and is only ever going to be a single entitlement.

<Collapsible content={() => import('/content/types/pkg/models/shared/app_entitlement_reference/go.mdx')} openLabel={Labels.showProperties} closeLabel={Labels.hideProperties} />


---
##### `UserID` *{`*string`}*
The UserID of who completed provisioning. For connector provisioning this is the system user id, for manual provisioning this is who clicked "provision complete"
